Number Thoery

The minimum no. of operations required to substract k^x from n and to reduce n to zero is the sum of digits of n in base k number system.

n : a number in any system.
n%k:- fetches the last digit in base k system.
n=n/k: deletes the last digit in base k system.

For Example :n=5(decimal system) say k=2 then n(=5)=101 in base k=2 system.
n%k=5%2=1 (last digit of 5 in binary rep)
n=n/k = 5/2=2(=10 in binary,last digit =1 deleted)

n%k=2%2=0 (second last digit of 5 in binary system)
n/k=2/2=1(=1 in binary system second last digit of 5 deleted)

n%k=1 (first digit of 5 in binary system)
n/k=1/2=0 (all digits of 5 in binary system is deleted)
